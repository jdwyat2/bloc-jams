#Explain the difference between absolute and relative positioning.
    
##absolute:
    * absolute positioning takes the box out of the flow of the rest of the website/application's flow and lets all other content render like the box is not there.
    
    * Because the box is out of the flow of the rest of the content its top and bottom margins can be used to center the box (assuming that the margins are both auto)

##relative:
    * allows the box to be centered in its container. The container itself is still subject to the flow of the rest of the website.




#Explain how box-sizing: border-box treats content differently than the default box-sizing

    * box-sizing allows the overall size of the box (including padding, margin, content, and borders) to stay the same when we manipulate the size of the box's padding, border, etc.
    
    * boxsizing: border-box will allow the width and height to stay the same when padding and borders are added.
